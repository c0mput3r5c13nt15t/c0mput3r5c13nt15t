<b>Hello 👋</b><br>
I’m Paul Maier an 18-year-old student from Germany.

<b>My interests 👀</b><br>
I'm pretty much interested in everything that has to do with computer science or technology in general, but my focus lies on:
- Web development (mostly Next.js)
- Cybersecurity
  - Learning key concepts, e.g. the OSI model
  - Practising/understanding different tools and attacks, e.g. EAP attack, web exploitation
  - and much more!

<b>My current projects 🌱</b><br>
- Building useful software for my school @Birklehof
- Different competitions ([BwInf](https://bwinf.de/bundeswettbewerb/), CTFs, etc.)
- Learning cybersecurity

<b>Collaborations 💞️</b><br>
I'm not really planning to collaborating on anything, but I'm open for it!
